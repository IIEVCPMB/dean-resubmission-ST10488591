This project is a React Native mobile application developed as a Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for a private chef named Christoffel. The app allows the chef to manage a dynamic digital menu that can be updated daily and viewed by guests.
The application enables the chef to add, view, and remove menu items, including the dish name, description, course type, and price. Menu items are displayed on the home screen along with the total number of items and the average price per course. A separate screen allows guests to filter menu items by course.
The app was developed in three stages:
* Part 1: User interface planning and screen design
* Part 2: Core functionality, menu management, and navigation
* Final PoE: Refactoring, advanced features, filtering, and calculations
The final app is cross-platform, user-friendly, and demonstrates key React Native and TypeScript concepts.
